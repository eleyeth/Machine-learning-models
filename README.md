# Machine learning models for classificatino and regression e.g. -Spam-classifier-
ML models including Spam classifier , testing classification rates on different ML algorithms including Random Forest, Naive bayes, AdaBoost and linear regression and neural networks 


#LR, RF have the same classificcation rate. Interesting to see if it is the same on larger datasets or more varied datasets
